      Demonstrate how projects can be created from filters. A new project will be created for every task that is under
      the 'Garage Sale 🏚️💵' project. Each new project will be 'seeded' with a template and the originating task will
      be deleted from `Garage Sale 🏚️💵`

          filters:
            - filter:
                # Any task that...

                  content:
                    match: "."
                    option:
                      delete: yes

                projects:
                  # ... is in this project
                  name:
                    match: 'Garage Sale 🏚️💵'

        # New projects will be ROSE colored
        color: ROSE
        # And created as child projects of `Garage Sale 🏚️💵`
        parent:
          project: Garage Sale 🏚️💵
