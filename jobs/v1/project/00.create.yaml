      Demonstrate how projects can be created from filters. A new project will be created for every task that is under
      the 'Garage Sale 🏚️💵' project. Each new project will be 'seeded' with a template and the originating task will
      be deleted from `Garage Sale 🏚️💵`

          filters:
            - filter:
                # The '.' character is how you say 'ANY CHARACTER' with regex, so this filter will match
                #   every task in your ToDoist account! Be VERY CAREFUL with this _especially_ when combining with the
                #   delete option!!!

                projects:
                  # But because search results are combined with the boolean AND, we can strip out all the tasks that
                  #   are not in this project!
