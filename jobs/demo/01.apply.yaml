##
# The actual demo which implements the two examples from readme:
#
# Apply the label `@at_work` to all tasks that:
#   - are in the `Inbox` project
#   - (and) have no label
#   - (and) end in `at work` **or** `at the office`.
#       - Remove the `at work` or `at the office`
#       portion of the task when saving it with the labels
#
# For every task in the `GarageSale` project:
#   - make a new project named after the task
#       - locate the new project under the `GarageSale` project
#   - 'Seed' the project with tasks from `sale-tasks.csv` file
#   - delete the original task from `#GarageSale`
