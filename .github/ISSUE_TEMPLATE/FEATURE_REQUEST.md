I would like a way to search for tasks that are due *between* two dates. For example, a way to select tasks
that are due either: yesterday, today, tomorrow. Right now, there appears to be no easy way to search for tasks using
multiple dates!

```text
Under the #MyDreamFeature project, I have:
    - a task with:
        - content: someTaskDueTomorrow
        - due date 'tomorrow'
        - labels:
            - my_label

    - a task with:
        - content: c
        - due date 'yesterday'

    - a task with:
        - content: someSimilarTaskDueIn3Days
        - due date 'in 3 days'
```


I would like a way to filter out all tasks with a date that is + or - one day. In the above example, the search results
return the tasks `someTaskDueTomorrow` and `someTaskDueTomorrow` but not `someSimilarTaskDueIn3Days`
